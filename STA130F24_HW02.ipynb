    "A) Discuss how quickly the ChatBot was able to be helpful for each of the above questions, and if so, how?\n",
    "The ChatBot was able to help me very quickly for each of the questions above. This is because it would come out with reponses fast, and instead of repeating what it said before whenever I asked questions for more calirfication it would break down the code further and further into detail, in relation with the Monty Hall Scenario or the Markovian code. It felt that when they got carried away I coudl bring the chatbot back to focus on one specific thing before asking it to relate the code to the bigger picture. \n",
    "\n",
    "B) Discuss whether or not interacting with ChatBot to try to figure things out was frustrating or unhelpful, and if so, how?\n",
    "I did not find anything unhelpful about the ChatBot, infact interacting with the ChatBot almost felt like interacting with a tutor in front of me. If there were certain parts of the code that I did not understand from the tutorials I missed by enrolling late, or something that I missed in the lectures I could have the chatbot explain the logic begind certain words or formatting of the code for me, in order to get a deeper understadning of the code and what it is doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Based on your experiences to date (e.g., including using ChatBots to troubleshoot coding errors in the previous homework), provide an overall assessment evaluating the usefulness of ChatBots as tools to help you understand code\n",
    "My experiences up to date have been overwhelmingly successfull. Overall it does feel like I am reaching out to an interactive textbook that can focus in or zoom out on a code for me to describe the analytics behind a code. However, it is safe to say that even if the ChatBot uses friendly language in their messages it is not the same as presenting your issue on a reddit forum persay, on forums with real people their solutions tend to be in a simpler language or more geared towards your specific problem because they had to work through it the same way you have too, whereas a chatbot is just using data inputted into it. The ChatBot seems to have the capability to do everything, and fails to lack the empathy or understanding to explain how to work through a mistake with you like a human who has made the same mistake can.

    "Reflect on your experience interacting with ChatBot and describe how your perception of AI-driven assistance tools in the context of learning coding, statistics, and data science has been evolving (or not) since joining the course\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe my perceptio of using AI tools has changed greatly since joining the course. Before I essentially would only use the help of a real life human, such as my teachers or peers, to help me understand a text/problem because I believed that it can only be accurately understand and explained by an actual human being, due to nuances in different problems and just the fact that your peers and teachers share the same social culture as you do. However, since joining this course I have seen how using AI-driven assisted tools in issues related heavily to tech language is greatly beneficial. Since the language used in python and terms used are greatly specific and cannot be subsituted as easily; such as words are in the english languages when speaking face to face with someone; a computer can be very helpful in giving you the exact definition, as there should only be one. There is less room for literacy critical reading error when using AI to help with something such as coding because it is such an exact language "
